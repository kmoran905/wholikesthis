# wholikesthis

This is a function that I created with Python that takes an array of people who liked a social media post and then displays the text.

[]                                -->  "no one likes this"
["Fred"]                         -->  "Fred likes this"
["James", "Paul"]                 -->  "James and Paul like this"
["Tyler", "Brad", "Sarah"]           -->  "Tyler, Brad and Sarah like this"
["Chad", "Richard", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Chad, Richard and 2 others like this"
